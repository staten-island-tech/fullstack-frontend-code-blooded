        Welcome to Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ð½ brought to you by Coded-Blooded! This web app allows you to
        play UNO, the popular real-time card game designed by Merle Robbins in
        1971.
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)#:~:text=History%20The%20game%20was%20originally%20developed%20in%201971,local%20businesses%20began%20to%20sell%20it%20as%20well."
          >(Wikipedia)</a
        >. The game is a race to be the first person to play the very last card
        in your hand. In this online variant, this is as simple selecting and
        clicking confirm for the card you want to place down. If you haven't
        played before, or need a refresher on what each card does, don't worry!
        We'll explain the rules below.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is a total of 108 cards in a deck of UNO cards:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>4 "wild cards"</li>
          <li>4 "wild draw four cards"</li>
          <li>25 cards for each color (red, yellow, green, blue)</li>
          <ul>
            For each color of the cards, there consists of:
            <li>1 zero card</li>
            <li>2 of each one through nine number card</li>
            <li>Action Cards:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>2 "skip cards"</li>
              <li>2 "reverse cards"</li>
              <li>2 "draw 2 cards"</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
